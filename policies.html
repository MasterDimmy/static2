We operate the Services from our offices in Nevada, and we make no representation that information and materials included in the Services are appropriate or available for use in other locations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration.&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">In the interest of resolving disputes between you and AUTOLOANAREA.COM in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and AUTOLOANAREA.COM agree to resolve disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction (&ldquo;Agreement to Arbitrate&rdquo;). Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. You acknowledge and agree that the arbitrator may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that individual party&rsquo;s claim(s). Any relief awarded cannot affect other users.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Claims To Be Resolved By Binding Arbitration</span><span class="c1">. You and AUTOLOANAREA.COM agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to: claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory; claims that arose before this or any prior Terms; claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Exceptions</span><span class="c1">. You and AUTOLOANAREA.COM agree that no statement herein shall be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either party&rsquo;s right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in any competent court of law; or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Arbitrator</span><span class="c1">. Any arbitration between you and AUTOLOANAREA.COM will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, &ldquo;AAA Rules&rdquo;) of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting AUTOLOANAREA.COM.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Notice and Process</span><span class="c1">. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by e-mail, a written Notice of Dispute (&ldquo;Notice&rdquo;). The Notice to AUTOLOANAREA.COM should be addressed to: info@autoloanarea.com. The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (&ldquo;Demand&rdquo;). If you and AUTOLOANAREA.COM do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or AUTOLOANAREA.COM may commence an arbitration proceeding.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Fees</span><span class="c1">. In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, AUTOLOANAREA.COM will, at your request, reimburse you for your payment of the arbitration filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any request for payment of fees by AUTOLOANAREA.COM should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and AUTOLOANAREA.COM will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), you agree to reimburse AUTOLOANAREA.COM for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by AUTOLOANAREA.COM on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA&rsquo;s rules. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. Any in-person arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Las Vegas, Nevada. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator&rsquo;s ruling on the merits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">No Class Actions</span><span class="c5">. </span><span class="c2">You and </span><span class="c5">AUTOLOANAREA.COM </span><span class="c2">agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Unless both you and AUTOLOANAREA.COM agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person&rsquo;s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Opt-Out</span><span class="c1">. If you are a new AUTOLOANAREA.COM user, you can choose to reject the arbitration agreement contained in this Section 12 (&ldquo;opt-out&rdquo;) by mailing us a written opt-out notice (&ldquo;Opt-Out Notice&rdquo;). The Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than thirty (30) days after the date you accept these Terms for the first time. You must mail the Opt-Out Notice to the Notice Address listed in Section 12(D), above. The Opt-Out Notice must contain your name, address (including street address, city, state and zip code), and the user name(s) and email address(es) associated with the AUTOLOANAREA.COM account(s) to which the opt-out applies. You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate. If you opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate, all other parts of the Terms will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Agreement to Arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with AUTOLOANAREA.COM.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Modifications</span><span class="c1">. If AUTOLOANAREA.COM makes any future change to this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. You acknowledge and agree that, in the event you reject any future change, your account with AUTOLOANAREA.COM shall be immediately terminated and you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Severability and Enforceability</span><span class="c1">. If an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Section 12 is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Section 12 shall still apply. If the entirety of this Section 12 is found to be unenforceable, then the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 11 shall govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms, and that the remainder of the Terms will continue to apply.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Modification of the Services.&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">AUTOLOANAREA.COM reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, some or all of the Services at any time without any notice or further obligation to you. You agree that AUTOLOANAREA.COM will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of any of the Services.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">General.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Entire Agreement</span><span class="c5">. These Terms, together with the&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Privacy Policy</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and AUTOLOANAREA.COM regarding your use of and access to the Services, and except as expressly permitted above may only be amended by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of the parties.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">No Waiver</span><span class="c1">. The failure to require performance of any provision shall not affect our right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default of the Terms constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Paragraph Headers</span><span class="c1">. Use of paragraph headers in the Terms is for convenience only and shall not have any impact on the interpretation of particular provisions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Severability</span><span class="c1">. In the event that any part of the Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part shall be given effect to the greatest extent possible and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Partner Terms</span><span class="c5">. In some instances, AUTOLOANAREA.COM&rsquo;s third party partners require that AUTOLOANAREA.COM &nbsp;users agree to be bound by some additional terms of use that are specific to particular products or services (&ldquo;Partner Terms&rdquo;). In the event of any conflict between the Partner Terms and AUTOLOANAREA.COM&rsquo;s Terms of Use, AUTOLOANAREA.COM&rsquo;s Terms of Use govern and control.</span></p></body></html>
